# LINMA1702 - Optimization models and methods
Group project which was focused on COVID-19 vaccination in Belgium. Given some datasets, we minimized the number of death people accross the entire country, by shipping vaccines to vaccination centers, under budget and transport constraints. The project is divided into two parts : Linear and Integer Programming (Part I and II).
